# FinTech App

A simple FinTech one page web application with ReactJS by using this figma UI design: [Figma Demo UI](https://www.figma.com/file/xVjgaNjJEIppeEkA2kGgrx/Front-end-Developer-Test-Scenario?node-id=0%3A1) . Used react functional components, hooks, react-router-dom and SCSS. For managing state used context api. Tried to use design pattern with the latest ReactJS features and made the UI user friendly.
